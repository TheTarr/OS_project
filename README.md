# OS_project

 Using C language to construct a shell.
 
# Files

 Operating system course project, you can find the requirements (4 phases in total) in the pdf file. 

 The files in each folder is the final version I submitted. You can ignore whatever outside (I don't remember what are those so just leave them there).
 
 I didn't find a runnable file online when I was doing this homework so I uploded my version. If you're searching for help like me at that time, I hope this finds you well ^_^

# The commands you need to execute each phase
 
 cd to the folder
 
 make (if there is a makefile)
 
 ./myshell

# If you have any question or need any help

 Feel free to shoot an issue, I'll be glad if I can help.
