# OS_project

 Using C language to construct a shell.

 Operating system course project, you can find the requirements of my homework (4 phases in total) in the pdf file. 

 The files in each folder is the final version we submitted.
 
 I didn't find a runnable file online when I was doing this homework so I uploded my version. If you're searching for help like me at that time, I hope this finds you well ^_^


# The commands you need to execute each phase
 
 cd to the folder
 
 make (if there is a makefile)
 
 ./myshell
